  # Admin GraphQL IDE - VTEX IO

  Select your app and start **writing**, **simulating** and **testing requests** to validate your GraphQL API using `GraphiQL` (a graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE).

  To install this app, just go to your VTEX IO workspace and run:
  
  ```
  vtex install vtex.admin-graphql-ide
  ```
  
  As soon as it is installed the button `GraphQL IDE` will already appear in the section "Store Setup" of your `admin` menu (left side of your screen in the admin page). 
  
  The URL path is `<your-website>/admin/graphql-ide`. Have fun!
